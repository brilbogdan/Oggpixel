A simple SWF-based OGG streamer that can be embedded in a website and
controlled via JavaScript.

This is a true streamer -- NOT a progressive downloader.

No GUI of any kind is rendered, but a JavaScript interface is provided for
controlling it.

Most of this code is not mine:
  * the stuff in com.automatastudios is probably from automatastudios.com,
    though I can't find any reference to it there now. It came from the
    [Alchemy library sample][alchemy]. I fixed some bugs in it that prevented
    endless streaming of OGG files.
  * oggvorbis.swc is a machine-converted AS3 bytecode version of
    libogg + libvorbis and is licensed under the LGPL.
